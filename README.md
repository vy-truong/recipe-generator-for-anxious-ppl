## 🌟 Project Overview  
Many people face decision fatigue when cooking, spending a lot on groceries only to feel anxious when it’s time to cook and often end up eating unhealthy food instead.  
I created **MotiChef** with the intention of helping others, including myself, make the process of cooking healthy meals easier and more approachable.  
It suggests personalized recipes based on available ingredients, helping users reduce food waste, save time, and rediscover the joy of cooking.

## 💡 What I Learned  
Through MotiChef, I strengthened my ability to:  
- Build **AI-integrated full-stack applications** using Next.js and Supabase  
- Optimize **data queries** for performance and user responsiveness  
- Design **human-centered experiences** that solve real-life problems with empathy
